Problem 1 (/15): 14 points
1.4 This problem here is unrelated to overfitting. The fitted curve does not even pass through all points. Although that would also be problematic, if you could successfully build a 35 degree polynomial. (-1 pt)

Problem 2.1—2.3 (/25): 25 points
2.3: invgamma could use `np.clip` to clamp values to a range. Copies are also unnecessary here (-0pts)
